# Nextflow playground
Repo to test and play with Nextflow.io

Currently this was done:

```bash
# Install nextflow
curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash
export PATH=$HOME:$PATH
# Clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:bmpvieira/nextflow-playground.git
# Run the most basic pipeline taken from examples at nextflow.io
cd nextflow-playground
nextflow script.nextflow
```

The input was one fasta file that was split by sequence and each sequence reversed.
Nextflow generated two folders (one for each step of the pipeline), each one with several log files (command run, stdout, stderr, etc), symlinks to input files and in the last folder the resulting output files generated by this pipeline.
